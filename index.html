                <p> Hi! My name is Raymond He.
                    I am currently taking this full stack course in hopes to change my
                    career field. So far, this course has been challenging but at the same time I feel a sense of
                    belonging in this field. I guess that makes me feel optimistic about my future in computer sciences.
                    Outside of this class I am currently working as an Assistant Living Facility Manager in the
                    International District of Seattle,
                    so my commutes to class are not so bad. When I am not working or studying I am most likely at a
                    bar playing boardgames with friends.
                    My hobbies include playing boardgames, cooking, hiking, and trying to get better at racquetball.
